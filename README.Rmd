This package contains an interface to the US Department of Labor API in R. The goal
of this project is to provide an easy to use interface to access various open source
datasets provided by the DOL. The DOL is an overarching department with various agencies
under it. For example, one of the most popular, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). 

Although there already exists an R package for the BLS, this provides datasets 
under the oversight of the DOL.

The US Department of Labor provides a web API located at 
https://developer.dol.gov/beginner/ where this library will pull data from.
